##Tag Editor

This project is something that I thought might be cool and fun to do. Basically what I would like for it to become is a tool that allows you to tag files (any file, unlike what the filesystem lets you do) and also link files that are related.

Ultimately, you will be able to see details about each tag and details about the links between files.

A visual mapping of tag importance and a web of links would also be cool.
